# MLPipelineIntro
Machine Learning Pipeline in Python
The Python Notebook is about basic implementation of ML Pipeline, covering a scenerio showcasing the importance of ML Pipeline
Steps involved in the notebook-
1. Load boston housing dataset
2. Compare the results - scenerio 1: Running algorithm on scaled data versus scenerio 2: using basic pipeline to do the same
Hyperparameter tuning using grid search in ML pipeline
using hyper parameters tuning and multiple algorithms in ML pipeline
